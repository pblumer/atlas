# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records the significant architectural decisions made on Atlas, using the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-influenced format described in [`template.md`](template.md).

An ADR captures a decision, the context that forced it, the options considered, and the consequences accepted. ADRs are immutable once accepted: if a decision changes, a new ADR supersedes the old one rather than editing it.

| [0102](0102-receive-tasks.md) | Receive tasks — an activity that waits for a correlating message, reusing the message-catch machinery | Accepted |
| [0103](0103-live-collaborative-modeling-sessions.md) | Live collaborative modeling sessions — real-time co-editing of drafts by people and AI agents | Proposed |

| [0105](0105-per-server-call-activity-target-overrides.md) | Per-server call-activity target overrides — route, pin, or disable a call activity's target on one server | Proposed |
| [0105](0105-sharepoint-connector.md) | SharePoint connector — create a list item via Microsoft Graph, provider managed and OAuth credential in the vault | Accepted |
| [0106](0106-bmc-remedy-connector.md) | A BMC Remedy connector — server-registered ITSM entry creation via the AR System REST API | Accepted |
| [0107](0107-backup-and-restore.md) | Backup and restore — a one-file gzip-tar download of the design-time data directory, secrets excluded | Accepted |
| [0108](0108-bpmn-transactions.md) | BPMN transactions — a transaction subprocess whose cancel end event compensates completed work in reverse order, then routes out an always-interrupting cancel boundary | Accepted |
| [0109](0109-full-instance-snapshot.md) | Whole-instance snapshot — a full backup including the WAL (running instances), users and vault key; restore staged and applied on restart | Accepted |
| [0110](0110-event-based-gateways.md) | Event-based gateways — a deferred choice that arms several catch events at once; the first to fire wins and the rest are cancelled | Accepted |
| [0111](0111-incident-model-completion.md) | Completing the incident model — job retry backoff (a retry timer holds the job off the index until due), recurring-timer re-arm FEEL-failure incidents, and start-timer FEEL failures caught at deploy | Accepted |
| [0112](0112-send-tasks.md) | Send tasks — the single outbound element, kind chosen at author time: job/connector kinds are a distinct `TypeSendTask` reusing `serviceTaskBehavior` (the `TypeConnectorTask` precedent) with connectors/boundaries/I/O/incidents inherited; a `messageRef` kind compiles to `TypeMessageThrowEvent` (correlate, then flow on) with no new runtime | Accepted |
| [0113](0113-org-wide-ui-theme.md) | Org-wide UI brand theme — the Console accent colour stored on the server (public read, admin-gated write) and applied for every user; the browser caches it only to avoid a flash | Accepted |
| [0114](0114-opensearch-event-exporter.md) | OpenSearch event exporter — a WAL-tailing sink off the hot path, bounded by the durable position watermark (I2), resumable and idempotent, opt-in via server config | Accepted |
| [0115](0115-history-retention-hard-delete.md) | History retention — an export-gated, age-based hard delete of finished instances via a durable IntentPurged event; bounded sweep, opt-in, counters untouched | Accepted |
| [0116](0116-terminate-end-events.md) | Terminate end events — `<terminateEventDefinition>` ends its enclosing flow scope at once (root → instance, subprocess → subprocess then parent continues), reusing `terminateScopeExcept` + `completeScope`; `cancelEndEventBehavior` minus compensation, no new recovery path | Accepted |
| [0117](0117-ai-agent-task.md) | An AI agent task — an LLM agent as a managed connector on the job path: the call runs in a post-fsync worker and its result is frozen into the completion event (never re-invoked on replay), authored via the connector catalog with a vault-resolved credential, with a durable agent-run audit record | Proposed |
| [0118](0118-web-scraping-connector.md) | Web-scraping connector — a model-authored URL + CSS selector service task that fetches a page and extracts matching elements into a JSON array via the job path (goquery in the worker only, no engine change); model-authored like REST, read-only GET so no idempotency key | Accepted |
| [0119](0119-deactivate-deployed-process.md) | Deactivating a deployed process — an operator flag that keeps a definition deployed but stops its timer/message/signal start events from auto-starting new instances; operator config on the deploy sidecar (like call-activity overrides), gated live in the create path so replay is unaffected | Accepted |
| [0120](0120-mockup-service-task.md) | Mockup (engine-simulated) service tasks — an `<atlas:mockupConnector>` task the engine plays itself: a random-duration one-shot timer (no blocking worker), an optional FEEL input→output result, and a fail probability that raises a job-less incident; duration/failure drawn deterministically from the frozen timer key so replay is unaffected | Accepted |
| [0121](0121-bpmn-lanes.md) | BPMN lanes — organizational metadata with no execution semantics (compiler records each node's lane, Operations/Tasks expose it); a lane *references* an Atlas group (never equals one) so a user task without its own `candidateGroups` inherits it as a compile-time default, explicit assignment winning; layered A (metadata) now, B (assignment default) and C (access control) deferred | Accepted (Layer A) |
| [0122](0122-protected-system-project-and-bootstrap-deployment.md) | A protected system project and bootstrap-deployed platform processes — Atlas's own operating processes (user intake, access review, offboarding) live in a reserved `system`-owned project that is non-renameable/deletable/overwritable, embedded in the binary and idempotently deployed at startup by content checksum; the native Users console stays the direct/break-glass surface while governed processes are the front door, both writing the one user store | Accepted |
| [0123](0123-sanctioned-user-provisioning-for-system-processes.md) | A sanctioned automated user-provisioning path for system processes — a dedicated, least-privilege in-process `userConnector` (create/set-password/disable) gated to the ADR-0122 system project and behind its human approval step, audited, reusing the user store's safety rails and carrying no credential in the model; narrowly reopens the ADR-0044/0049 "automation cannot manage users" rule for platform processes only. Amended 2026-08-14: shipped default is opt-out (on by default; `--user-provisioning=false` disables) | Accepted (amended) |
| [0124](0124-server-side-diagram-auto-layout.md) | Server-side BPMN diagram auto-layout in Go — Atlas builds and maintains its own hand-written layered generator (`api/layout.go`) that synthesizes diagram interchange in-process for layout-less models and the Auto-layout/F8 re-flow, chosen over every library option because no mature Go layouter exists and the JS ones (ELK/elkjs, bpmn-auto-layout, dagre) or native Graphviz would trade the CGO-free single-binary, deterministic, server-side read path for a foreign runtime | Accepted |
| [0125](0125-escalation-events.md) | Escalation events — a named/coded signal thrown by an escalation intermediate throw (continues) or end event and caught by the nearest enclosing escalation boundary/event subprocess; propagates structurally up the scope chain like an error (ADR-0089), but the catch may be **non-interrupting** (handler runs alongside the still-running activity) and an **uncaught escalation is benign** (no incident); reuses `propagateError`'s walk and the non-interrupting fire path, no new subscription/value/recovery path | Accepted |
| [0126](0126-self-service-registration-link.md) | Self-service registration link on the login screen — an unauthenticated visitor starts Atlas's own intake process (ADR-0122) via a public start link (ADR-0029) surfaced as a "Registrieren" link, driven by a public org-wide `registration` setting (ADR-0113 shape); the intake start form drops the role field and the admin assigns the role at approval, so an anonymous requester can never self-elevate — the human Freigabe stays the privilege gate | Accepted |
| [0127](0127-layered-layout-pipeline-and-invariants.md) | A layered layout pipeline and executable layout invariants — layout quality is defined by predicates over a model corpus (nothing overlaps, no edge crosses a box it does not connect, labels stay clear, forward flows read left-to-right, the happy path is the longest chain and is straight) instead of coordinate assertions that pin the implementation; the generator adopts the layered-drawing phases it skipped, one per change — cycle removal and longest-run trunk selection landed, dummy nodes with crossing minimization and a port model proposed — because the observed defects were missing phases, not mis-tuned constants; explicitly does **not** reopen ADR-0124's library decision. Amended 2026-08-17: phase 2 was measured before being built — zero crossings across the corpus (including models built to provoke them) and space already reserved by footprint rows, so dummy nodes and crossing minimization were dropped in favour of two smaller fixes (a node takes the free row nearest its predecessors' median; channel-routed edges run their vertical legs in column gutters), and the score became a budgeted test; phase 3 (ports) unaffected | Accepted (amended) |
| [0128](0128-process-applications.md) | Process applications — the ADR-0034 project elevated into the design-time unit of bundling, versioning, and portability: an application publishes its artifacts as one versioned release (a bundle-level counter above ADR-0019 per-process versions), deploys to named remote Atlas servers via the remote's existing deploy API, and binds to a git repository over the ADR-0107 serialization; on-disk `projects/`/`projectId` stay unchanged (zero migration) while API/UI/MCP rename to "application" with deprecated `/projects` aliases; stays below the HTTP API with the invariants untouched, phased rename → releases → remote targets → git | Proposed |
| [0129](0129-remote-deployment-targets.md) | Remote deployment targets — publish a process application to another Atlas server: a target is admin-owned config (base URL + a vault credential *reference*, TLS always verified) in the ADR-0041/0105 category; the far side authenticates a **durable scoped deploy token** resolved to a non-admin publish-only principal (extending ADR-0049's bearer→principal path) rather than a borrowed human password; one **bundle-import request** carries the release manifest with already-resolved models so the remote validates and deploys all-or-nothing as it does locally; the release **version travels with the bundle** (a release is what shipped, a target is where it runs); the remote's application id is learned into a per-target **binding record** (a portable key is left to Phase 4); the outbound call runs **off** the run loop, and multi-target publishing is non-atomic by construction and reported per target | Proposed |
| [0130](0130-deprecating-a-process-version.md) | Deprecating a process version — a **drain** state distinct from ADR-0119 pausing: `deprecated` accepts no new instances by *any* route (auto-start, explicit API, call-activity target) while its running instances drain, making "stop new work → drain → delete" possible; rejects making supersession itself non-startable, because deploying a newer version already retires the old one's message/signal/timer starts and old versions stay deliberately targetable via ADR-0105 version pinning; records that ADR-0119 "paused" does **not** block an explicit start today | Proposed |
| [0131](0131-engine-recovery-checkpoints-and-wal-compaction.md) | Engine recovery checkpoints and WAL compaction — recovery replays the WAL from genesis (O(total log), and no segment is ever deletable), so introduce a periodic **Pebble checkpoint of the state store at a known applied log position** plus an engine-owned **manifest** (format version, partition, applied/highest position, key counter, state checksum, deployment refs); taken **on the run loop at a batch boundary** (single-writer-safe, exact position) after a durable flush, published atomically via temp-dir + rename + parent fsync; startup picks the newest valid checkpoint, replays only the **suffix after its applied position**, and **falls back to an older checkpoint or genesis** on any corruption; a segment becomes deletable only below both a durable checkpoint and every consumer watermark (ADR-0114 exporter, ADR-0115 retention); explicitly **not** ADR-0109's whole-instance backup; sliced ADR+manifest-primitives → create+publish → restore+suffix-replay → compaction → operator controls | Accepted |
| [0132](0132-link-events.md) | Link events — BPMN's off-page connector: a link intermediate throw and catch paired by name within one flow scope act as a **goto**, resolved **entirely at compile time** to a synthetic sequence flow (`b.Connect`) with both events reusing the existing `passThroughBehavior`; no new runtime, value type, event, or recovery path — the token flows throw ⇢ catch ⇢ its outgoing flow like any node. Deploy errors for an unmatched throw or a duplicate catch name | Accepted |
| [0133](0133-standard-loop-activities.md) | Standard loop activities (the ↻ marker) — `<standardLoopCharacteristics>` repeats an activity while a FEEL condition holds, run as a *sequential multi-instance whose iteration set is a condition*: it reuses the ADR-0077 body/iteration scope machinery unchanged (no new value type, counter, or recovery path), adding only `testBefore` / `loopMaximum` / the condition to the compiled loop detail. An iteration's result lands on the body and is promoted when the loop ends, so a looping activity leaves behind what the same activity would leave running once. The Modeler's Loop section covers both markers in one Mode select read from (and written to) the very element bpmn-js draws the icon from, so the property and the icon cannot drift | Accepted (amended) |
| [0134](0134-git-backed-applications.md) | Git-backed applications — a repository is an application's **source**, distinct from ADR-0129 promotion which moves what is *deployed*: a curated source layout (real `.bpmn`/`.dmn`/form files plus a manifest) rather than the sidecar JSON, deliberately departing from ADR-0107 option C because a backup wants exact opaque restore while a repository wants legible diffs; `go-git` so the binary stays CGO-free and self-contained; **Atlas never merges** — a diverged branch is refused, not three-way merged, because a plausible-looking BPMN merge can deploy and be silently wrong; and a **portable application key** in the manifest that survives a clone, which also settles the identity question ADR-0129 deferred | Proposed |
| [0135](0135-retries-as-a-task-property.md) | Retries as a property of every job-backed task — the retry budget the incident model (ADR-0061) spends is authored on each task's implementation extension (`<zeebe:taskDefinition retries>`, a connector's own `retries`, `<atlas:jobScript retries>`, `<zeebe:calledDecision retries>`), parsed by one shared helper that defaults to 3 and **refuses a budget below 1 at deploy** (a job with no attempt is never activatable, so it would park a token with no incident to resolve); a connector's attribute wins over a task definition on the same element, closing the gap where a modeled connector or a polyglot script task could not express the property at all. The Modeler appends one Retries field to every catalog kind, and the budget survives a switch of implementation kind. Compiler + authoring only — the compiled details already carried the field | Accepted |
