// Package api is the single-binary server surface for Atlas: it embeds one
// engine.Processor behind an HTTP API and serves an embedded web UI, so a single
// self-contained binary can deploy BPMN models, run instances, and (as the UI
// grows) view them in a browser. See ADR-0011.
//
// # Respecting the single-writer invariant
//
// The engine is a single-writer partition (invariant I3): exactly one goroutine
// may touch a partition's processor and state. HTTP handlers, by contrast, run
// concurrently. The Server bridges the two by owning a run loop goroutine that is
// the sole toucher of the processor; handlers submit closures to it via do and
// block for the result. No processor method is ever called from a handler
// goroutine directly.
//
// # Scope of the skeleton
//
// This is the Milestone S skeleton (ROADMAP.md): deploy XML, create an instance,
// read stats, health, and a static UI shell. Deployments are durable via an
// on-disk sidecar store (ADR-0019) reloaded on startup, so diagrams, versions,
// and recovered instances survive a restart; the eventual event-sourced
// deployment path arrives with the Milestone 4 public API. One honest limitation
// remains: there is no streaming job-worker transport yet (that follows the gRPC
// job protocol, ADR-0007), so an instance parks at its service task — exactly the
// "waiting token" the live viewer shows. Such a parked job can be finished by
// hand over HTTP (POST /jobs/{key}/complete, the operator mirror of .../fail from
// the incident model), but that is a synchronous operator affordance, not the
// leased, at-least-once worker protocol.
