# Browser end-to-end tests

These tests drive the web UI in a real headless browser (Playwright + Chromium). They
exist because parts of the UI — notably the Design-view **token simulation**
(`api/web/token-simulation.js`) — are plain browser JS running on the vendored bpmn-js, and
their behaviour can only be verified with a DOM and real event/animation timing. The Go
suite can't reach them.

The harness loads the repo's **real** production assets: `server.mjs` serves `../api/web` at
the root, so `harness.html` pulls in the same `bpmn-modeler.js` bundle and
`token-simulation.js` the app ships. Only `harness.html` and `model.bpmn` are test-only —
they live here rather than in `api/web` on purpose, because `api/web` is `go:embed`'d into
the binary and must not carry test fixtures.

## Run locally

```bash
cd e2e
npm ci                                   # first time
npx playwright install chromium          # first time (downloads the browser)
npm test
```

`npm test` starts the static server itself (via the Playwright `webServer` config) and tears
it down afterwards. Use `npx playwright test --headed` to watch it, or
`npx playwright show-trace test-results/**/trace.zip` after a failure.

## What's covered

- **`token-simulation.spec.mjs`** — message semantics across two pools (ADR-0101): a thrown
  message **delivers to a waiting catch** (both pools complete), a message with **nothing
  waiting is not buffered** (the later catch still parks), and a parked catch **still fires
  manually** (the ⚡ / `step()` path).
- **`gateways.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0096): the **exclusive** gateway pauses for a choice and routes
  down the picked branch (and **auto-decide** runs it hands-free); the **parallel** gateway
  forks both branches and the join merges to one completion; the **inclusive** gateway
  activates a chosen subset and the **quiescence OR-join** still converges to one completion.
- **`multi-instance.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0097 / ADR-0100): a modelled **loop cardinality** drives
  the instance count and ticks down; a **data-driven** activity falls back to the
  toolbar-configurable default.
- **`backup.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0107 / ADR-0109): the **Console → Backup** view — the nav entry
  opens it, both the design-time backup and the whole-instance **full snapshot** expose their
  `.tar.gz` download links and restore controls, and each restore flow validates an empty
  selection, then reports the file count and restart note on a (mocked) successful upload.
  Drives the real app shell against a mocked `/api/v1` (backup/restore hit the Go API, which
  the static harness doesn't run).
- **`call-activity-replay.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0076): the **call-activity drill-down** in the
  Operations instance replay — a call activity whose timeline step carries a `childInstanceKey`
  turns its "+" marker into an invisible click hotspot (single click → the child's replay, same
  window) and shows a "Called process" link in its Details panel; a plain element carries
  neither. Drives the real `mountInstanceReplay` against a mock `api`.
- **`call-activity-modeler.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0076): the **Process ID picker + create-new** in
  the Modeler's call-activity Implement panel — selecting the call activity offers a datalist of
  existing callees (deployed processes and drafts), and "＋ Create new process" saves the caller,
  POSTs a starter draft keyed by the entered id, and navigates to it. Drives the real
  `mountEditor` against a mock `api`.
- **`standard-loop-modeler.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0133): the **Loop section** in the Modeler's
  Implement panel — the panel reads the ↻ standard loop an imported activity carries,
  choosing a mode draws (or clears) the marker on the shape and exports the matching
  `<standardLoopCharacteristics>`, and switching to a multi-instance replaces one marker
  with the other. This is the icon-and-property sync check: both directions, in a real
  browser, against the vendored bpmn-js.
- **`documentation-modeler.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0025): the **Documentation** property — every
  element (task, gateway, event, sequence flow, data object) shows the `<bpmn:documentation>`
  its model carries and writes an edit back onto that element, blanking it drops the child
  entirely, and the edit is undoable; the process (nothing selected), a pool *and* the process
  it executes, a black-box pool and the collaboration each take their own. Assertions are on
  the exported XML, because passthrough is the whole contract.
- **`tasks-documentation.spec.mjs`** (ADR-0025 amended): a user task's documentation in the
  **Tasks app** — the detail pane leads with the modeler's instruction (above the metadata
  rows and the form), keeps the author's paragraph breaks, and shows no block at all for a
  task whose element carries none. Drives the real app shell against a mocked `/api/v1`.

Each spec loads its own model via `harness.html?model=…`; the `.bpmn` fixtures live here.

## Rendering a conformance gallery diagram

`render-diagram.mjs` + `render-diagram-harness.html` turn a conformance fixture into its
catalog image (`api/web/conformance-diagrams/<name>.png`), rendered by the same vendored
bpmn-js the Modeler uses so the picture shows the real markers. It is a hand-run asset
tool, not part of the suite:

```bash
node server.mjs &
node render-diagram.mjs ../conformance/models/standard-loop.bpmn \
     ../api/web/conformance-diagrams/standard-loop.png
```

The fixture needs hand-authored BPMN-DI — bpmn-js renders nothing without it.

## CI

The `e2e` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs this suite on every push and PR, in
parallel with the Go `check` job.
