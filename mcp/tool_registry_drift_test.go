// The MCP server is a pure adapter over the Atlas HTTP API (ADR-0016): every
// advertised tool proxies to exactly one /api/v1 operation, and MCP is strictly
// a subset of HTTP. Unlike the HTTP↔OpenAPI surface — which cannot drift because
// TestOpenAPICoversEveryRoute reads one route table — nothing structurally stops
// the MCP surface from silently falling behind the API as new endpoints land.
//
// This test is that missing guard. It classifies every HTTP operation as either
// covered by a named tool or deliberately omitted, and fails when a new route is
// neither — so adding an endpoint forces a conscious decision (expose it, or
// record why not) instead of an unnoticed capability gap. The maps below are the
// single source of that decision; keep them honest and this test keeps the two
// surfaces from drifting apart the way issue #198's follow-up warned they could.

// mcpToolRoutes maps each advertised MCP tool to the "METHOD /pattern" HTTP
// operation it proxies to. Every entry must be a real API route and every
// advertised tool must appear here (both asserted below).
